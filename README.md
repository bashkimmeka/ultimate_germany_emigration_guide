# Moving to Germany as a Software Engineer/Developer from Albania (could help other non-Eu places, not sure about that)

So, you got your contract in a company in Germany? Well congratulations. This is the ultimate guide on what you need to do after you get your contract as a non-Eu citisen.

## You still haven't found a job in Germany but you want one?

I personally got lucky on [Stack Overflow jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) but I have a fiew other links for you too:

### [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm)
### [Moberries](https://www.moberries.com/)
### [Linkedin(You have to work hard on your profile though)](https://www.linkedin.com/)

## Software scopes that should be looking for a job in Germany:

I have noticed that Germans don't use .Net, C# or that kind of stuff, so the market for those topics looks a little rough. Mobile developers, all kind of JavaScript developers, Java back-end (or even Kotlin) developers look pretty lucky IMO.

# Setting things off

## After the communication of your acceptance:

I believe Germans love a *written* confirmation from you. Like: Yea, I accept. (at least). 

# The leaving your country process

Unfortunately, as a non-Eu Albanian citizen, you would need hell lot of time to set things off right. You need at least 3 months to prepare to get there.

# Blue card process

I believe that every software engineer salary should make you qualified for the blue card. What the heck is the Blue Card? Well, the Greek call it *Prasino Karta*, the Italians call it *Carta Biancha*, the Americans call it *The Green Card*. The Germans call it *Die blaue Karte* (Don't be scared of Der, Die, Das yet). It's just a card where you take permission from the German goverment to stay 4 years in Germany. It all depends on the salary though. If it is *43K+* per year, you are fully qualified for it.

## How do you apply for this Blue Card

Well, you can't imediately apply for that. You need a 6 month VISA and once you have that, you can come to Germany to apply for it.

## The Visa process

Once you have all the agreement with the company, you should imediately schedule a meeting at the [Embasy of Germany in Albania](https://tirana.diplo.de/). 
Germans don't usually create confusion on any website, so the process should be pretty easy. So in order to schedule a meeting on the German Embassy, I am redirecting you to an [information link](https://tirana.diplo.de/al-sq/service/-/2076500), and the schedule link is just on the bottom of the page (just in case they change the links sometimes).

### Please read the whole process and do exactly the ammount of actions required. Not more, not less.
